import PackageDescription

/*
 * AetherEngine, for the app to link, pinned to one version: the engine ships
 * its FFmpeg build with it, and the app is tested against one.
 *
 * Its optional components (TrueHD Atmos and DTS:X object rendering, Dolby
 * Vision dual layer) stay off: the app plays TrueHD and DTS-HD as 7.1 PCM, as
 * Infuse does. To turn one on, add `traits: [...]` to the dependency here;
 * XcodeGen can't set a package's traits, which is why this package exists.
