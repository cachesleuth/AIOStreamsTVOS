import PackageDescription

/*
 * AetherEngine, for the app to link, pinned to one commit: the engine ships
 * its FFmpeg build with it, and the app is tested against one.
 *
 * The commit is on the app's fork, branch `aiostreams`: upstream 7.54.0 plus
 * lossless surround (TrueHD, DTS-HD) delivered as 24-bit PCM with a labelled
 * channel layout instead of FLAC, so tvOS switches the HDMI link to
 * multichannel with Continuous Audio Connection off, and 7.1 in CoreMedia's
 * channel order. Back to an upstream version once that is released there.
 *
 * Its optional components (TrueHD Atmos and DTS:X object rendering, Dolby
 * Vision dual layer) stay off: the app plays TrueHD and DTS-HD as 7.1 PCM, as
 * Infuse does. To turn one on, add `traits: [...]` to the dependency here;
 * XcodeGen can't set a package's traits, which is why this package exists.
