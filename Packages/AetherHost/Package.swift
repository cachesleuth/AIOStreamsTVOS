/*
 * AetherEngine, for the app to link, pinned to one commit: the engine ships
 * its FFmpeg build with it, and the app is tested against one.
 *
 * The commit is on the app's fork (mickey2266/AetherEngine, branch
 * `aiostreams-7.56`): upstream 7.56.0 plus two fixes for the engine's software
 * player (interlaced H.264 and the like):
 * - It labelled 7.1 MPEG_7_1_C, which put the side and rear surrounds in each
 *   other's speakers; it now labels it WAVE_7_1 (Dolby's TrueHD 7.1 channel
 *   check on a Samsung HW-Q990F). The AVPlayer route's FLAC bridge was right
 *   as upstream has it.
 * - E-AC-3 Atmos it hands to tvOS compressed played nothing beside the
 *   engine's silent Atmos loop (the soundbar showed Dolby and stayed silent);
 *   the loop no longer runs beside it.
 * Back to an upstream version once those are released there.
 *
 * Its optional components (TrueHD Atmos and DTS:X object rendering, Dolby
 * Vision dual layer) stay off: the app plays TrueHD and DTS-HD as 7.1 PCM, as
 * Infuse does. To turn one on, add `traits: [...]` to the dependency here;
 * XcodeGen can't set a package's traits, which is why this package exists.
 * The app sets `objectAudioRendering` (for E-AC-3 Atmos on the software
 * player), so turning on either audio trait starts rendering its objects.
